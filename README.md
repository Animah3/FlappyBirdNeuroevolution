# FlappyBirdNeuroevolution
Using TheCodingTrain's Flappy Bird Neruoevolution as a baseline, I attempted the project myself.
Most ideas/code presented are not wholly my own. This was just a learning project and I do not take credit.

To run this code, you need to download the Toy Nueral Network library. If you don't wish to change the html file, you would need to put the library into a folder titled "JSLibraries", exact capitlization, then you would place the JSLibraries folder in the same folder as the code I have posted!.
